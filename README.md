# Big Data Traffic Analysis and Prediction 🚦📊

## 📝 Overview
This project analyzes traffic patterns using historical **big-data** (GPS coordinates, sensor logs) to predict **traffic congestion** and optimize routes with **Machine Learning**. 

The code processes traffic datasets, extracts features like **peak hours** and **road congestion**, and predicts future trends using **ARIMA** models. 

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Data Processing**: Handles and cleans traffic datasets.
- 🔄 **Time Series Prediction**: Forecasts traffic volume using **ARIMA** models.
- 🕰️ **Visualization**: Plots real-time and predicted trends using **Matplotlib**.
- 🚦 **Traffic Insights**: Identify high-congestion periods and suggest optimizations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: Data processing and manipulation.
  - Matplotlib: Data visualization.
  - Statsmodels: ARIMA time series forecasting.
  - Requests: Fetch traffic data.

## 📂 Project Structure

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-analysis.git
cd traffic-analysis
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure Python is installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels requests
```

### 3️⃣ Prepare the Dataset
1. Download the traffic dataset from **NYC Open Data**:
   [NYC Traffic Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Traffic-Volume-Counts-2012-2013-/i4gi-tjb9).
2. Save the CSV file as `traffic_data.csv` in the project folder.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code
Run the script to analyze and forecast traffic data:
```bash
python traffic_analysis.py
```

### **What the Code Does**:
1. **Fetch and process data**: Cleans traffic data and resamples it to hourly intervals.
2. **Visualize traffic trends**: Plots historical traffic volume.
3. **Predict future traffic**: Uses ARIMA to forecast traffic volume for the next 24 hours.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Integrate **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models for improved accuracy.
- Real-time traffic analysis with live APIs (Google Maps, Waze).
- Interactive dashboards using **Tableau** or **Dash**.
